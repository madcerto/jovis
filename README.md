# jovis
Youtube video explanation: (will be linked here in future)

the jovis programming language can be best described as a thin metaprogramming wrapper on top of assembly; the language itself provides no control structures, no memory management, nothing that you would expect a programming language to provide. what it instead provides is a versatile type system and direct, but managed, access to assembly, which allows you to code in any control structures, paradigms, or high-level features yourself. many useful implementations can be found in the standard and core libraries (currently WIP)
